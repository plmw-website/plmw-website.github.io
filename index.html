                I attended my first PLMW in 2017, having previously taken one programming languages course. I definitely did not understand most of the technical talks given at PLMW. However, since the talks introduced different areas of research, I felt much more prepared for the ICFP research talks. I also met many of my current friends in my peer group at PLMW; friends I still see today at various conferences.
                </p>
                <p>
                My experience at PLMW greatly influenced my path since then. I've attended every ICFP since 2017 and gave a talk at the co-located Scheme Workshop in 2019. The talk I gave was better because of the helpful tips from Derek Dreyer's talk during my first PLMW. I also applied to graduate school with a special interest in compiler correctness because of Amal Ahmed's talk during this same PLMW. I am currently finishing my first year of my Master's/PhD program researching type preserving compilation because of PLMW (and ICFP in general, as I met my current advisor at ICFP 2018).

                PLMW changed my life and my career trajectory. I honestly applied to POPL on a whim one year because I was working a low-wage job in Los Angeles (where POPL was being held) and being a PhD student volunteer was the only way I could afford to attend. ACM conferences can be expensive. It was only after volunteering at that conference and talking to Ranjit Jhala that I had it in my head that I might pursue a PhD. But in what, and how? And no one I work with has a PhD or gone to grad school for Computer Science, much less PL. This is where PLMW came in. Almost immediately, I met someone who had not only travelled a similar path, but openly engaged with me, and others who told me to follow up with them for help and mentorship applying to schools. Others I met even encouraged me to submit a paper or collaborate on a research paper with them. I had never written a single research paper before. I went from Pallet Jacks and helping 53 foot trucks back into a facility, hearing the sound of welding and machining all day, while sitting at a computer trying out small programmes in LISP, to being a fully-funded PhD student within a year. I owe a lot of that to PLMW.

                    I went to PLMW at the end of my 5-year degree in mathematics and computer science, at the time when I was pondering whether academia — and more concretely PL — was for me. It helped me fight my biggest two fears at that moment: is there a good "vibe"? is PL a narrow topic? I was surprised about the breadth of PL as an area and the many relations to other disciplines. But even more about how accessible and open everybody was, not only at PLMW itself, but at the rest of the conference afterwards.

                    Virtual PLDI 2020 gave me a chance to attend PLMW for the first time. For a first-timer like myself, it was incredibly enlightening to see how experienced people in the PL field were sharing their research experience and other stories of building their (research) career in non-technical, everyday English during PLMW mentoring sessions. I highly recommend PLMW to anyone who is not sure where and how to begin research in the PL field, or how to prepare for their graduate program and/or research career. Speakers and mentors you will come across via PLMW are truly inspiring and very much willing to address any of your questions or concerns. I’ve been very happy to be left with actionable information and a long to-do list!

                    I went to ICFP in St. Louis (2018) funded by PLMW. That was my first time attending a conference, ever, so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. Surprise! It was GREAT!! Honestly there were so many highlights but the biggest thing for me was finally realizing that there's a whole community out there of like-minded folks who are all very excited about PL, but everyone in their own unique way. It's really cool to find out that folks all over the world also care about these problems, and that it's not just you and your advisor working on this niche thing. Also, some of the conversations I had with PLMW attendees have changed, and shaped my own research agenda and aspirations, so I can't emphasize enough how enriching some of those interactions were. Overall, attending PLMW helped me find my place in this community, and made me excited to continue being a part of it.

                    I attended my first PLMW at POPL 2013 in Rome. At the time, I was an undergraduate who was considering what to do next after graduation. By the time PLMW and POPL were over, I knew I wanted to pursue a PhD and for the first time, I had the confidence to believe that it might be possible.

                    The mentorship at PLMW was invaluable to me. For example, I did not understand most of the talks at POPL which definitely would have discouraged me if I had not learned at PLMW that this was normal for your first academic conference.

                    Seven years on, I have now finished my PhD and I am still in touch with some of the friends I made at PLMW.

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <p>
        <b>I'm not from a famous university. Can I still get funding?</b>
        Absolutely! We want to encourage students from all backgrounds to attend PLMW. We have a limited number of travel grants available for students who need financial support, and we prioritize students who would not otherwise be able to attend the conference.
        <p>

        <b>I have a disability. Can I attend?</b>
        Yes! The conference venue is chosen to be accessible to all attendees. If you have any specific requirements, please let us know when you register so that we can make sure you have everything you need.
        <p>

        <b>I don't know anything about programming language theory.</b>
        That's okay! PLMW is designed to be accessible to students at all levels. You don't need to be an expert in programming languages to attend. The talks are designed to introduce you to new ideas and help you understand the current state of the field.
        <p>

        <b>Will there be an exam?</b>
        No! PLMW is not a course, and there are no exams. The goal of the workshop is to introduce you to new ideas and help you prepare for a career in programming languages research. There are no grades, and you don't need to have any prior knowledge to attend.
        <p>

        <b>My {gender, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, age, disability status} is X. Will I be the only one?</b>
        PLMW is an inclusive international event, and we welcome students from all backgrounds. For instance, some of the best PL researchers and many past PLMW speakers and attendees are women.
        We strive to create a welcoming and supportive environment for all attendees. The associated conference organises a Women in PL lunch ♀️, and a LGBTQ+ in PL lunch 🏳️‍🌈, in parallel to the general lunch, which are great opportunities to meet other students and researchers.

        No, you do not need to prepare anything before attending PLMW.
        <p>

        <b>What should I bring to PLMW?</b>
        You do not need to bring anything to PLMW. If you want to take notes, you can bring a pen and notebook if you like, but you can also get those from the sponsor booths at the conference.
